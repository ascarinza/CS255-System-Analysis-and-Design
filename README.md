# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

	The Client, DriverPass, was a company looking to enter the driver’s education space. They had plans to offer online classes and exams as well as in-person driving practice. The system would be responsible for tracking user accounts, class registrations, and hosting the online classes and exams. Some requirements for the system were that I had to be cross-operating system compatible. It was also made clear that the product would be a website and this website needed to be cross-browser compatible as well. There were three main users of the system, the customer (student), drivers, and administrators. These all needed different roles and permissions.

3. What did you do particularly well?

	I believe that I was able to take the interview dialog and transform this information into diagrams quite well. Having the information from the client is one thing but being able to create system diagrams explaining what they are looking for is very important. The development team needs accurate diagrams to work off and I think I provided detailed and organized diagrams.

3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   
	If I were to go back and improve upon one part of the project, it would be the latter half of the business requirements. This section of the requirements described all the different software, tools, and hardware I would need to implement for the system to operate. I think I could have provided some more details and given specific information on the tools I would have used.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   
	After getting a sense of what the user is looking for, it is usually quite easy to implement parts of the system that they did not explicitly ask for, but you know what needs to be added. The client is usually not as technical as the development team so oftentimes they know what they want the system to do but don’t know the best way to do it. Our client, for example, first wanted the system to be used online and offline but also wanted data to be stored on the site. We knew that if data was changed offline then it would not match up when the system came back online. We were able to explain how this could be an issue and direct them towards choosing a website that would always be online. The user’s needs are the focus, but we need to ensure what they are asking for makes sense and will be in their best interest. In the example above, we did not force them to choose a website, but instead provided the possible issues and allowed them to choose and agree on the best approach. The whole point of designing and creating the system is for the user so making sure they are happy with the product is the most important thing.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
   
	Developing programs is an iterative process and one that is complemented very well with the agile framework. Oftentimes, programming is unlike other projects where there is a strong structure and set rules and regulations one must follow. Programming is the process of innovation so knowing that something won’t be fully correct the first time around allows for
